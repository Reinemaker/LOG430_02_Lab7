# Monolithic Architecture Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the removal of all monolithic architecture components from the CornerShop project.

## üóëÔ∏è Files Removed

### Core Monolithic Files
- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Monolithic Docker Compose configuration

- **`Dockerfile`** - Monolithic application Dockerfile
- **`CornerShop/`** - Entire monolithic application directory
- **`CornerShop.Tests/`** - Monolithic application test suite

## üîÑ Scripts Updated

### `quick-start.sh`
**Changes:**
- Removed fallback to monolithic architecture
- Now requires `docker-compose.microservices.yml` to exist
- Removed monolithic URL references
- Updated to only show microservices URLs
- Removed monolithic health check fallback

### `run-load-tests.sh`
**Changes:**
- Removed architecture auto-detection
- Now defaults to microservices architecture only
- Removed monolithic URL fallbacks
- Updated all test URLs to use API Gateway
- Simplified service checking logic

### `run-architecture-comparison.sh`
**Changes:**
- Removed direct monolithic service testing
- Now focuses only on API Gateway performance
- Removed `DIRECT_BASE_URL` configuration

### `run-observability-comparison.sh`
**Changes:**
- Removed monolithic architecture availability check
- Now runs microservices load tests only
- Simplified architecture comparison logic

## üìù Load Test Files Updated

### `load-tests/01-initial-load-test.js`
- Changed default URL from `http://cornershop.localhost` to `http://api.cornershop.localhost`

### `load-tests/02-load-balancer-test.js`
- Changed default URL from `http://cornershop.localhost` to `http://api.cornershop.localhost`

### `load-tests/03-cache-performance-test.js`
- Changed default URL from `http://cornershop.localhost` to `http://api.cornershop.localhost`

### `load-tests/04-architecture-comparison-test.js`
- Removed `DIRECT_BASE_URL` configuration
- Removed direct service testing (monolithic)
- Now only tests API Gateway performance
- Simplified test structure

## üîß Configuration Files Updated

### `services/ApiGateway/nginx.conf`
**Changes:**
- Removed `https://cornershop.localhost` from CORS configuration
- Updated CORS headers to only include microservices-related origins

## üìö Documentation Updated

### `README-SCRIPTS.md`
**Changes:**
- Removed all references to monolithic architecture
- Updated script status table to remove monolithic column
- Removed migration guide from monolithic to microservices
- Updated usage examples to focus on microservices only
- Removed monolithic access URLs section

### `docs/README-Microservices.md`
**Changes:**
- Updated "Migration from Monolith" section to "Architecture Benefits"
- Removed references to preserved monolithic application
- Updated benefits to focus on microservices advantages

## üéØ Result

The project is now **100% microservices-focused** with:

### ‚úÖ What's Available
- **Microservices Architecture**: Complete microservices setup
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and authentication
- **Individual Services**: Product, Customer, Cart, Order services
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple cart service instances
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, health checks
- **Testing**: Comprehensive microservices testing suite
- **Documentation**: Updated for microservices only

### ‚ùå What's Removed
- **Monolithic Application**: Complete removal
- **Monolithic Tests**: All monolithic test suites
- **Monolithic Configuration**: Docker Compose and Dockerfile
- **Monolithic References**: All URLs and fallbacks
- **Architecture Comparison**: No longer compares with monolithic

## üöÄ How to Use

### Start Microservices
```bash
./start-microservices.sh
```

### Test Microservices
```bash
./test-microservices.sh
```

### Load Testing
```bash
./run-load-tests.sh
```

### Quick Start
```bash
./quick-start.sh
```

## üåê Access URLs

All services are now accessible through:
- **API Gateway**: http://api.cornershop.localhost
- **Product Service**: http://product.cornershop.localhost
- **Customer Service**: http://customer.cornershop.localhost
- **Cart Service**: http://cart.cornershop.localhost
- **Order Service**: http://order.cornershop.localhost

## üîë Authentication

All API calls require the API key:
```
X-API-Key: cornershop-api-key-2024
```

## üìä Impact

- **Reduced Complexity**: No more architecture switching logic
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed ~50% of configuration complexity
- **Focused Testing**: All tests now target microservices
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single architecture to maintain
- **Better Documentation**: Clear, focused documentation

The project is now streamlined for microservices development and deployment only.
