# Choreographed Saga Pattern Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the choreographed saga pattern for distributed transaction management in the Corner Shop microservices system. The implementation follows the requirements specified in the criteria and provides a complete event-driven solution for coordinating distributed transactions.

## 1. Analysis of Existing Scenario

### Business Scenario
The existing scenario involves an e-commerce system with multiple microservices:
- **OrderService**: Manages order creation and processing
- **StockService**: Handles inventory and stock reservation
- **PaymentService**: Processes payments
- **NotificationService**: Sends notifications to customers
- **CustomerService**: Manages customer information
- **ProductService**: Manages product catalog
- **CartService**: Handles shopping cart operations

### Distributed Transaction Flow
When a customer places an order, the system must:
1. Create the order
2. Reserve stock for the ordered items
3. Process payment
4. Confirm the order
5. Send confirmation notifications

If any step fails, the system must compensate (rollback) the completed steps to maintain data consistency.

## 2. Choreographed Saga Design

### Global Transaction Flow
The choreographed saga pattern uses events to coordinate the distributed transaction:

```
OrderCreatedEvent → StockReservedEvent → PaymentProcessedEvent → OrderConfirmedEvent → NotificationSentEvent
```

### Event Types

#### Initiation Events
- **OrderCreatedEvent**: Triggers the saga when an order is created
  - Contains: orderId, customerId, totalAmount, items

#### Success Events
- **StockReservedEvent**: Published when stock is successfully reserved
- **PaymentProcessedEvent**: Published when payment is processed
- **OrderConfirmedEvent**: Published when order is confirmed
- **NotificationSentEvent**: Published when notification is sent

#### Compensation Events
- **OrderCancelledEvent**: Published when order is cancelled
- **StockReleasedEvent**: Published when stock is released
- **PaymentRefundedEvent**: Published when payment is refunded

#### Saga State Events
- **SagaStartedEvent**: Published when saga begins
- **SagaCompletedEvent**: Published when saga completes successfully
- **SagaFailedEvent**: Published when saga fails
- **SagaCompensationStartedEvent**: Published when compensation begins
- **SagaCompensationCompletedEvent**: Published when compensation completes

### Compensation Strategy
The compensation follows the reverse order of successful operations:
1. **OrderCreated** → **OrderCancelled**
2. **StockReserved** → **StockReleased**
3. **PaymentProcessed** → **PaymentRefunded**

## 3. Technical Implementation

### New Services Created

#### ChoreographedSagaCoordinator Service
- **Purpose**: Tracks saga state and coordinates compensation
- **Features**:
  - Event consumption from Redis streams
  - Saga state management in Redis
  - Automatic compensation triggering
  - Prometheus metrics collection
  - REST API for monitoring

#### Event Infrastructure
- **ChoreographedSagaEvents.cs**: Complete event definitions
- **EventConsumer**: Consumes events from Redis streams
- **EventProducer**: Publishes events to Redis streams

### Modified Services

#### OrderService
- Added new endpoint: `POST /api/orders/choreographed-saga`
- Publishes `OrderCreatedEvent` to initiate saga
- Handles compensation events for order cancellation

### Key Components

#### ChoreographedSagaState Model
```csharp
public class ChoreographedSagaState
{
    public string SagaId { get; set; }
    public string BusinessProcess { get; set; }
    public string InitiatorId { get; set; }
    public ChoreographedSagaStatus Status { get; set; }
    public DateTime StartedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime? CompletedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime? FailedAt { get; set; }
    public string? FailureReason { get; set; }
    public List<ChoreographedSagaStep> Steps { get; set; }
}
```

#### Saga Coordinator Service
- Handles all saga events
- Updates saga state in real-time
- Triggers compensation when failures occur
- Publishes saga state events

## 4. Testing and Observability

### Test Script: `test-choreographed-saga.sh`
Comprehensive test script that validates:
- Service health checks
- Successful saga execution
- Saga statistics and metrics
- State filtering and querying
- Date range filtering
- Compensation tracking
- Error handling

### Metrics and Monitoring

#### Prometheus Metrics
- `choreographed_saga_started_total`: Total sagas started
- `choreographed_saga_completed_total`: Total sagas completed
- `choreographed_saga_failed_total`: Total sagas failed
- `choreographed_saga_compensation_triggered_total`: Total compensations
- `choreographed_saga_duration_seconds`: Saga duration histogram

#### Grafana Dashboard
- **Choreographed Saga Monitoring**: Complete dashboard with:
  - Saga overview statistics
  - Success rate gauge
  - Duration distribution
  - Events over time
  - Compensation rate
  - Active sagas count
  - Status distribution pie chart
  - Step completion bar gauge

### API Endpoints for Monitoring
- `GET /api/choreographedsaga/states` - Get all saga states
- `GET /api/choreographedsaga/statistics` - Get saga statistics
- `GET /api/choreographedsaga/metrics` - Get saga metrics
- `GET /api/choreographedsaga/state/{sagaId}` - Get specific saga state

## 5. Architecture Benefits

### Decoupling
- Services communicate only through events
- No direct dependencies between services
- Easy to add new services or modify existing ones

### Scalability
- Each service can scale independently
- Event-driven architecture supports high throughput
- Redis streams provide reliable message delivery

### Fault Tolerance
- Automatic compensation on failures
- Event replay capability for recovery
- Comprehensive error handling

### Observability
- Complete audit trail of all operations
- Real-time metrics and monitoring
- Detailed saga state tracking
- Performance analytics

## 6. Comparison with Orchestrated Saga

| Aspect | Choreographed | Orchestrated |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Coordination | Event-driven | Central orchestrator |
| Coupling | Loose | Tight to orchestrator |
| Scalability | High | Limited by orchestrator |
| Complexity | Distributed | Centralized |
| Failure Handling | Automatic | Manual orchestration |
| Monitoring | Event-based | Orchestrator-based |

## 7. Deployment and Configuration

### Docker Compose Integration
Added `choreographed-saga-coordinator` service to `docker-compose.microservices.yml`:
```yaml
choreographed-saga-coordinator:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: services/ChoreographedSagaCoordinator/Dockerfile
  environment:
    - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
    - ConnectionStrings__Redis=redis:6379
  depends_on:
    - redis
    - stock-service
    - payment-service
    - order-service
    - notification-service
```

- Grafana for visualization

## 8. Usage Examples

### Creating an Order with Choreographed Saga
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/orders/choreographed-saga \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "customer-123",
    "storeId": "store-1",
    "paymentMethod": "CreditCard",
    "totalAmount": 299.99,
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "product-1",
        "quantity": 2,
        "unitPrice": 149.99,
        "totalPrice": 299.98
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Monitoring Saga State
```bash
# Get all saga states
curl http://localhost/api/choreographedsaga/states

# Get saga statistics
curl http://localhost/api/choreographedsaga/statistics

# Get specific saga state
curl http://localhost/api/choreographedsaga/state/{sagaId}
```

## 9. Future Enhancements

2. **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for better performance
3. **Event Versioning**: Support for event schema evolution
4. **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle failed event processing
