# ADR 001: Application Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Corner Shop application needs to be:
- Maintainable and extensible
- Easy to test
- Performant
- Easy to deploy
- Scalable for future features

## Decision
We will implement a layered architecture with the following components:
1. Console UI Layer (Program.cs)
2. Service Layer (DatabaseService)
3. Data Access Layer (MongoDB integration)
4. Domain Models (Product, Sale, etc.)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual components
- Flexible for future extensions
- Maintainable codebase
- Dependency injection ready
- Easy to mock dependencies for testing

### Negative
- Initial setup requires more boilerplate code
- Need to maintain interfaces and abstractions
- Slightly more complex than a monolithic approach

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Approach
- Pros:
  - Simpler initial implementation
  - Fewer files and classes
  - Faster to get started
- Cons:
  - Harder to test
  - More difficult to maintain
  - Less flexible for future changes

### Microservices Architecture
- Pros:
  - Highly scalable
  - Independent deployment
  - Clear service boundaries
- Cons:
  - Overkill for our use case
  - More complex deployment
  - Higher resource requirements

## Implementation Notes
- Using interfaces (IDatabaseService) for dependency injection
- Implementing unit tests for each layer
- Using async/await for database operations
- Following SOLID principles
- Using proper error handling and logging
