# ADR 003: Testing Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Corner Shop application requires a robust testing strategy to ensure reliability, maintainability, and correctness of the system. We need to decide on the testing approach, tools, and coverage requirements.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy that includes:

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Use xUnit as the testing framework
   - Focus on testing individual components in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies (MongoDB)
   - Target 80% code coverage

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Use a test MongoDB instance
   - Verify database operations
   - Test end-to-end workflows

3. **Test Organization**
   - Separate test project (CornerShop.Tests)
   - Group tests by functionality
   - Use meaningful test names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Run tests automatically on pull requests
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Fail builds on test failures
   - Enforce minimum coverage threshold

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved code quality and reliability
- Early detection of issues
- Better maintainability
- Confidence in changes
- Documentation through tests

### Negative
- Additional development time
- Need for test maintenance
- Learning curve for new developers
- CI/CD pipeline complexity

## Implementation
1. Set up xUnit in the test project
2. Configure test coverage tools
3. Create initial test suite
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
5. Document testing guidelines
